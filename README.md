# Pyhash Bot App
Created by [@victoristocrat](https://github.com/victoristocrat) at [Pyhash.com](https://pyhash.com)
# Why open source?
Algo trading has been a well-kept secret within the crypto industry. It is expensive to have access to developers with the expertise to build a fullstack trading app. So [@victoristocrat](https://github.com/victoristocrat) at [Pyhash.com](https://pyhash.com) decided to release our proprietary app to the world, aiming to empower everyone with the ability to use trading bots.
# Who is this for?
You can be:
- Retail trader
- Day trader
- Algo developer
- Market Making
- Small to medium size prop trading firm
- or practically anyone...
# What is included?
Both the Django backend app and the React frontend app are included in this repo. I am working on improving deployment process and documentation.

# How to use?
Please go over our Wiki page to find our 
# Where to deploy
You can deploy on your personal computer with some environment tweak. But my strong recommendation is using a cloud provider so that you can leave your bot running 24/7 with a reliable internet connection.  
Popular providers:
- AWS
- Google Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Digital Ocean
- Heroku  

I will add deployment guide for those providers eventually.
# When are the updates?
I will try to push an update every week with minor improvements, tweaks, new strategies, new features, etc. If you want to volunteer, please contact me via Telegram [@victoristocrat](https://t.me/victoristocrat).
